Description: The goal of tgconfig is to provide infrastructure for managing package parameters. Parameters are easy to get in relevant functions within a package, and rrror is thrown if a parameter is missing. Developers are able to register parameters and set their default value in a config file that is part of the package in YAML format, and users are able to override parameters using their own YAML. Users get an exception when trying to override a parameter that was not registered, and can load multiple parameters to the current environment.
